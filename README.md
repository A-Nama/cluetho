## 🎯 About the Project

Built as my final project for **[Stanford University's Code in Place 2025](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)**, *Cluetho* is a fun, beginner-friendly Python game that helps players guess the right combination of **suspect**, **weapon**, and **room**.

It was coded from scratch using **Python** and **Tkinter**

## 🕵️ Gameplay

- Choose the number of players (2–6)
- Each player takes turns guessing the killer combo
- Get a hint if you're wrong (but only one 👀)
- Win the game by solving the full combo correctly
- And yes, be as *sassy* as you want when you win 😉

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (GUI framework)
